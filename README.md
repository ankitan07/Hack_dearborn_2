## Something to know: 
* **Nucleotide:** basic building block of nucleic acids (DNA , RNA). Nucleotides are arranged in sequences to form the genetic code and carry genetic information. four types: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G)
* **Amino Acid:** building blocks to form polypeptide chains, which then fold into functional proteins.proteins. (20 std tyeps) 
* **Peptide:** short chain of amino acids that have various biological functions and act as a precursors to proteins, regulatory roles in signaling pathways and other cellular processes.
* **Gene:** functional units of heredity, segment of DNA that contains instructions for building one or more molecules, typically proteins. 
* **Gene Variant:** or allele, is a specific version of a gene. Gene variants can differ in their DNA sequence, different forms of a protein or SNP. 
* **SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):**  genetic variation in which a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) at a specific position in the genome differs among individuals or populations. Most common type of genetic variation and can be associated with various traits, diseases, and individual differences.These genetic variations can affect three key processes: drug metabolism, drug targets, and disease pathways.


## Factors effecting variability in drug response among racial and ethnic groups 

* **Genetic Factors:** Can impact how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted within the body, as well as how they interact with receptors. (pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenetics)

* **Environmental Factors:** Factors such as diet, climate, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, and exposure to pollutants can affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and receptor interactions. For example, differences in diet can significantly alter the metabolism rate or blood levels of drugs among different ethnic populations.

* **Cultural Factors:** Attitudes and beliefs of an ethnic group, can influence the effectiveness of drug therapy and patient adherence. (pharmacoanthropology, medical anthropology, and cultural psychiatry). For example, cultural perceptions and beliefs can affect a patient's understanding of and adherence to medical treatment.

## Polymorphisms 
The most clinically significant polymorphisms are typically found in drug metabolism genes and can result in "poor metabolizer" (PM) phenotypes, leading to altered drug clearance and potentially increased adverse effects due to the accumulation of the drug.
* **Polymorphisms of Drug Metabolism:** :Most drugs are metabolized in the liver to become more water-soluble and easier to excrete from the body. This process often involves enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions, making the drugs more suitable for action.Cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19,help in drug metabolism(antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiarrhythmics) by converting drugs into their active or inactive forms.Genetic polymorphisms in some individuals lead to reduced enzyme activity, making them "poor metabolizers." This results in slower drug metabolism and can lead to higher drug levels in the bloodstream, potentially causing adverse effects.
Genes  NAT2 and TPMT polymorphisms  can lead to variable drug responses, emphasizing the need for personalized medicine.

* **Polymorphisms of Drug Targets:** Drug targets include various cellular components, such as receptors, enzymes, and ion channels that drugs interact with to produce their therapeutic effects. Genetic polymorphisms can affect the sensitivity of these targets to specific drugs. For example, variations in beta-adrenergic receptors can influence how individuals with asthma respond to beta-agonist drugs. Some individuals may have receptors that are more or less responsive to these drugs, affecting their therapeutic benefit.

* **Polymorphisms of Disease Pathways:** Impact on Disease Pathogenesis: Genetic polymorphisms related to the pathways involved in disease development can influence drug efficacy and affect how patients respond to treatment and their risk of developing certain diseases. For instance, polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E gene impact responses to drugs used in treating cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease. 

* **Racial and Ethnic Variations in Polymorphisms:** 
Racial and ethnic groups can exhibit variations in the frequencies of specific genetic polymorphisms. For example, the prevalence of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotypes is more common in White populations compared to Asian populations. Similarly, CYP2C19 slow metabolizer phenotypes are more prevalent in Asian populations than in White populations.
Polymorphisms related to acetylation, such as those involving the NAT2 gene, also show variations across populations. For instance, African American and White populations may have different frequencies of these polymorphisms, which can influence how certain drugs are metabolized in these groups.
