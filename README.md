# Something to know: 
** Nucleotide: ** basic building block of nucleic acids (DNA , RNA). Nucleotides are arranged in sequences to form the genetic code and carry genetic information. four types: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G)
** Amino Acid: ** building blocks to form polypeptide chains, which then fold into functional proteins.proteins. (20 std tyeps) 
** Peptide: ** short chain of amino acids that have various biological functions and act as a precursors to proteins, regulatory roles in signaling pathways and other cellular processes.
** Gene: ** functional units of heredity, segment of DNA that contains instructions for building one or more molecules, typically proteins. 
** Gene Variant: ** or allele, is a specific version of a gene. Gene variants can differ in their DNA sequence, different forms of a protein or SNP. 
** SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism): **  genetic variation in which a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) at a specific position in the genome differs among individuals or populations. Most common type of genetic variation and can be associated with various traits, diseases, and individual differences.
